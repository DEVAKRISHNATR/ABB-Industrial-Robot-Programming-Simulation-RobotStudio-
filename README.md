# ABB-Industrial-Robot-Programming-Simulation-RobotStudio-
ABB IRB 1200 industrial robot programming and simulation using RobotStudio and RAPID, focusing on robot kinematics, coordinate systems, motion control (MoveJ, MoveL, MoveC), workspace analysis, and validation of industrial automation tasks.
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on industrial robot programming, kinematic analysis, and simulation using an ABB IRB 1200 robot in ABB RobotStudio. The work was completed as part of the Automation and Robotics M1 module and demonstrates the integration of theoretical robotics concepts with practical industrial robot programming.

The project covers robot motion control, coordinate systems, tool configuration, and workspace validation using ABB’s standard industrial software and RAPID programming language.

🎯 Project Objectives

Understand industrial robot kinematics and control principles

Program ABB robots using RAPID language

Implement and compare different robot motion types

Configure tool centre point (TCP) and work object frames

Validate robot motion and reachability using simulation

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Industrial Robot: ABB IRB 1200

Simulation Software: ABB RobotStudio

Programming Language: RAPID

Key Concepts:

Forward and inverse kinematics

Jacobian and workspace analysis

Motion planning and path accuracy

⚙️ Robot Programming Features

The ABB IRB 1200 robot was programmed to perform standard industrial motion commands:

MoveJ – Joint motion for rapid positioning

MoveL – Linear motion for precise path following

MoveC – Circular motion for smooth curved trajectories

ZONEDATA parameters were used to control motion blending and positional accuracy.

🧭 Coordinate Systems & Tool Configuration

The project makes extensive use of ABB coordinate systems to ensure accurate and repeatable motion:

World Coordinate System

Base Frame

Tool Centre Point (TCP)

Work Object (Task Frame)

Correct calibration of TCP and work objects was essential for collision-free and precise robot operation.

🧪 Simulation & Validation

ABB RobotStudio simulations were used to:

Visualise robot trajectories

Analyse reachable workspace

Validate tool orientation and motion accuracy

Detect joint limits and potential singularities

The simulation environment closely replicates real industrial robot behaviour without requiring physical hardware.
🚀 Learning Outcomes

Hands-on experience with ABB industrial robots

Practical RAPID programming skills

Strong understanding of robot kinematics and motion control

Industry-standard simulation and validation workflow
